TODO
====

* Should skipping to a new state automatically trigger :enter Proc?
* Add loopback checking (i.e. when transitioning from a state back to itself)
* Add support for callbacks
* Consider using DataMapper's Enum type.
* Consider trying out a nested state machine.
* Not real happy with spec/unit/dsl:
  - specs are brittle
  - specs don't actually test much
